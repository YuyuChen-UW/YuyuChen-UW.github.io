## About Me

I am currently a Ph.D. student in Actuarial Science at the University of Waterloo, working under the supervision of Professor [Ruodu Wang](http://sas.uwaterloo.ca/~wang/) and Professor [Ken Seng Tan](https://uwaterloo.ca/statistics-and-actuarial-science/people-profiles/ken-seng-tan).

Before joining the University of Waterloo, I obtained my M.Sc. degree in Statistics from the University of Calgary, supervised by Professor [Alexandru Badescu](https://contacts.ucalgary.ca/info/math/profiles/101-152917). I received my B.Ec. in Actuarial Science from Southwestern University of Finance and Economics.

## Research Interests

I am interested in the research of actuarial science and risk management.
- **Robust risk aggregation** 
- **Dependence modelling** 
- **Financial derivatives**

## R package 
  **pmerge**: This package contains several useful functions/methods to merge p-values that are either independent or arbitrarily dependent in multiple hypothesis testing. The development version and its instruction are available at [Github](https://github.com/YuyuChen-UW/pmerge).
