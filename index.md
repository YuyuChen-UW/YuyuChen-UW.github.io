## About Me

I am currently a Ph.D. student in Actuarial Science at the University of Waterloo, working under the supervision of Professor [Ruodu Wang](http://sas.uwaterloo.ca/~wang/) and Professor [Ken Seng Tan](https://uwaterloo.ca/statistics-and-actuarial-science/people-profiles/ken-seng-tan).

Before coming to the University of Waterloo, I obtained my M.Sc degree in Statistics from the University of Calgary, supervised by Professor [Alexandru Badescu](https://contacts.ucalgary.ca/info/math/profiles/101-152917). I received my B.Ec in Actuarial Science from Southwestern University of Finance and Economics.

## Research Interests
I am interested in the research of actuarial science and risk management
- **Robust Risk Aggregation** 
- **Application of Affine GARCH Models** 

## Publications

-  Badescu, A., Chen, Y., Couch, M., and Cui, Z. (2019). Variance swaps valuation under non-affine GARCH models and their diffusion limits. **Quantitative Finance**, 19(2), 227-246.
